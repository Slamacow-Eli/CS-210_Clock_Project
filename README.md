#                                        **************Clock-Project*********************
This is a school project that I have worked on through Southern New Hampshire University that highlights my proficiency in the C++ language.
The goal of this project is to display a clock with a preset time (Not local time) via parameters.
The program should be able to display two clocks at the same time, one in the 12-hour format (11:37:32 PM) and the other in a 24-hour format (22:45:36) HH:MM:SS

The program should also be able to display a menu that gives the user 4 options.
Option 1 should add an hour to both clocks.
Option 2 should add a minute to the clocks.
Option 3 should add a second to both clocks.
The 4th option should allow the user to exit the program.
For each option, the screen should be cleared after each action to prevent a long list of prior clocks.

The work was mostly done locally on my machine through VisualStudio. 
I learned how to create repositories, commit and push from the environment and thats how i brought it to github.
This was a great learning experience that taught me a little about how to version control, and not have to open up github to push my work.

#                                         **************Going Forward*******************
Going forward I plan on making improvements to the clock.
Some ideas that I have on the list right now are for it read the time locally.
I also want the clock to display the current date.
Lastly, I would like to add a wakeup time as an alarm implementation.
